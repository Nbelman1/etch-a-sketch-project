# etch-a-sketch-project

This is part of The Odin Project curriculum. 

Oh yeah, it's all coming together. Welcome to another JavaScript Fundamentals project! 

The assignment is to create a webpage with a 16 x 16 square grid that fills in each square when moused over,
so that it looks like an etch-a-sketch. 

This will test my skills using HTML, CSS, and JS, specifically how they all can interact with and manipulate
one another. 

I hope you enjoy!
